        "  - The data on gun ownership was collected by the small arms survey. This includes the average firearms per 100 people, the average number of civilian firearms, and rank by the rate of gun ownership. The data has been normalized for a rate per 100,000 population. \n",

        "  - Data is missing for Russia, China, and Afghanistan\n",

        "- To capture the amount of homicides  due to personally owned guns we made a new interaction term - \"hom_firearms\", which is the average percent of homicides caused by firearms by the average number of firearms per 100 people.  Here we see that the US ranks the highest in the world. "

WISQARS provides death counts and death rates for the United States and by state, county, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, sex, leading cause of death, injury intent, and injury mechanism categories. WISQARS can be used to query death data for the years 2001 - 2017, of which the underlying cause of death is specified using ICD-10 codes. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in an agreement with the National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) has implemented a new, more restrictive rule for reporting state- and county-level death data for years 2008 and later from NVSS in order to avoid inadvertent disclosure of a decedent's identity. Therefore, the Statistics, Programming and Economics Branch, Division of Analysis, Research, and Practice Integration, NCIPC has modified WISQARS to accommodate the new data suppression rule; i.e., no figure, including totals, should be less than 10 in tabulations for sub-national geographic areas, regardless of the number of years combined with the 2008 and later data. Tabulations, charts, and maps produced by WISQARS using only NVSS death data for years prior to 2008 are not affected by this new rule. Therefore, queries of state-level data for years 1999 through 2007 will remain unrestricted; queries of state-level data that include 2008 or later are restricted. As a WISQARS user, please read the following data use restrictions and click \"I Agree.\" You will then be given access to this WISQARS module.\""

        "- Data collected from 2013 - Present(2019).\n",

        "- Mass Shooting Tracker uses various valid news sources for their data, and records these sources in their dataset.\n",
        "- The website defines a mass shooting as any firearm event involving in the injury or death of at least 4 people. \n",
