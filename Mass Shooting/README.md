## Mass Shooting Data
This data was collected from Mass Shooting Tracker, a .org website that searches the web to find information on mass shootings that occur in the US. The website defines a mass shooting as any firearm event involving in the injury or death of at least 4 people. The data provided by the website is a csv file for each year, beginning in 2013. We combined the 7 files into one dataset for ease of use.
