        "* The chart was rotated from vertical to horizontal: to make it consistent with the previous charts. It still compares each group easily, but the bars are thinner and chart took less space so everything is clear without the need of scrolling up and down after the revision.\n",
        "* The titles of the two bar charts were combined to make the chart look cleaner, since both bar charts are there to prove the same argument. The title was changed to focus on the states that decreased gun laws instead of those increased to make the argument in the same direction as our other arguments.\n",
        "* Grid lines were removed because they are unnecessary to understand the chart and the background is less busy without them.\n",
        "* Field labels were hidden for rows to avoid redundancy, since the meaning of the rows is already explained in the legend and caption, making the chart look cleaner. \n",
        "* The y-axis label of the old left chart was changed to specify that these were from mass shootings.\n",
        "* We removed the labels on the old x-axis because we would be repeating the same information that the legend has. We chose the legend because it maintains consistency with other graphs\n",

        "\n",
        "  - The data on firearm homicides was collected by the UNODC through its annual crime survey. This includes the percent of homicides from using a firearm, the number of homicides from using a firearm, and the rate of homicide rate per 100,000 in the population. \n",
        "   \n",
        "  - The data on gun ownership was collected by the small arms survey. This includes the average firearms per 100 people, the average number of civilian firearms, and rank by the rate of gun ownership. The data has been normalized for a rate per 100,000 population. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Limitations:\n",
        "  - Data is missing for Russia, China, and Afghanistan\n",
        "  - While the Google Spreadsheet says that it is being automatically updated every 5 minutes, the columns for homicide per country that was collected from the UNODC doesn't have information about what year it is for.\n",
        "   - The data is from an annual crime survey, and it doesn't say if the numbers are being averaged across all years, or if the numbers are for the latest year\n",

        "- Central/South America leads on all murder stats, far ahead of US.\n",

        "\n",
        "- To capture the amount of homicides  due to personally owned guns we made a new interaction term - \"hom_firearms\", which is the average percent of homicides caused by firearms by the average number of firearms per 100 people.  Here we see that the US ranks the highest in the world. "

WISQARS provides death counts and death rates for the United States and by state, county, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, sex, leading cause of death, injury intent, and injury mechanism categories. WISQARS can be used to query death data for the years 2001 - 2017, of which the underlying cause of death is specified using ICD-10 codes. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in an agreement with the National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) has implemented a new, more restrictive rule for reporting state- and county-level death data for years 2008 and later from NVSS in order to avoid inadvertent disclosure of a decedent's identity. Therefore, the Statistics, Programming and Economics Branch, Division of Analysis, Research, and Practice Integration, NCIPC has modified WISQARS to accommodate the new data suppression rule; i.e., no figure, including totals, should be less than 10 in tabulations for sub-national geographic areas, regardless of the number of years combined with the 2008 and later data. Tabulations, charts, and maps produced by WISQARS using only NVSS death data for years prior to 2008 are not affected by this new rule. Therefore, queries of state-level data for years 1999 through 2007 will remain unrestricted; queries of state-level data that include 2008 or later are restricted. As a WISQARS user, please read the following data use restrictions and click \"I Agree.\" You will then be given access to this WISQARS module.\""

        "- Data collected from 2013 - Present(2019).\n",
        "  -  The data provided by the website is a csv file for each year, beginning in 2013. We combined the 7 files into one dataset in Excel for ease of use.\n",
        "- Mass Shooting Tracker uses various valid news sources for their data, and records these sources in their dataset.\n",
        "- The website defines a mass shooting as any firearm event involving in the injury or death of at least 4 people. \n",
        "- This data has been featured by CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Economist\n",
        "- Limitations:\n",
        "   - This data is compiled by crowd-sourcing\n",
        "   - While we would have liked to find a government funded data source on this topic,  Congress has effectively blocked the CDC from researching the underlying causes of gun violence as of December 2015, so this is a well compiled dataset from published researchers who volunteer their time. \n",
        "   - Our major analysis for mass shootings data was only from 2013 through 2017. With more data we feel that this analysis can be significantly strengthened, since it might take more than a few years to see significant changes in mass shooting deaths with changes in gun laws.  \n",
        "   - Our case study was for states that had two or more gun law changes in either the positive or negative direction (23 states), but we only saw the significant changes in mass shootings deaths per capita in 4 of the 23 states. \n",
